Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). It was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. The system went live on 30 July 2015.

While Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, was developed as a decentralized digital currency, Ethereum focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application. More simply, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.

Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used primarily for two purposes: as a digital currency, like Bitcoin, and is used inside Ethereum to run applications and even to monetize work. 

Ethereum has faced criticism for perceived security issues and for the blockchain's ability to scale effectively. However, it has also received praise and support for its ability to host and support dApps, for its contribution to blockchain development, and for its future potential in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its smart contract features make it a highly valued platform in the blockchain world.
