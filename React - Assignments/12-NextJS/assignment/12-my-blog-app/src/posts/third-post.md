Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. It is designed to provide scalable and user-friendly solutions for developers and users.

Polygon aims to address some of Ethereum's major limitations, including its throughput, its poor user experience (high speed and delayed transactions), and its lack of community governance. By introducing a layer 2 chain, Polygon essentially provides a scaling solution that achieves higher throughput by creating a parallel network for off-chain computation while leveraging the Ethereum network for security.

The Polygon ecosystem provides a range of standalone chains and secured chains. Standalone chains are sovereign Ethereum sidechains, which provide the highest degree of flexibility but rely on their own security. On the other hand, secured chains leverage the security of the Ethereum network or a pool of professional validators.

Polygon's native token, MATIC, is used for a variety of purposes in the Polygon ecosystem, including participating in network governance by voting on Polygon Improvement Proposals, contributing to security through staking, and paying gas fees.

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, solutions like Polygon will play a crucial role in addressing scalability issues and fostering the wider adoption of blockchain technology.
